Q:what is the difference between an interceptor and a pipe between http requests and responses ? * An interceptor is a mechanism that allows you to intercept and modify HTTP requests or responses before they are sent or received by the server.Interceptors are typically implemented as middleware in a server or client application. * A pipe, on the other hand, is a mechanism for transforming data as it passes through a stream.   Pipes are useful for enforcing data validation rules and ensuring that the data received by the server is in the expected format.  Interceptors are used to intercept and modify HTTP requests or responses.
